# Non-real electron mode linac 

A non-real electron mode linear accelerator based upon Christopher Poole's [generic GEANT4 python platform](https://github.com/christopherpoole/linac).

CADMesh has been removed due to inability to create a working install.

An example of what the notebook code running the simulation can be viewed [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/SimonBiggs/linac/blob/master/main.ipynb)

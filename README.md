# The aim
My aim is to have a ready working easy to use non-real linear accelerator with minimal dependencies. I will use it as a frame upon which to set up a true linac which I will be unable to release. Hopefully others can make use of this non-real set up, especially for education purposes.

Eventually I will write a beginner friendly installation guide assuming someone has just produced a fresh install of Ubuntu 14.04 LTS inside virtual box.

It is not yet at a useful state.

# Details 
The real hard work given here has been done by Christopher Poole, his more powerful linac platform can be found [here](https://github.com/christopherpoole/linac).

CADMesh has been removed due to inability to create a working install. Will eventually also remove G4VoxelData.

An example of the notebook code running the simulation can be viewed [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/SimonBiggs/linac/blob/master/main.ipynb).
